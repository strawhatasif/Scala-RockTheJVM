The package declaration must be at the top of a file (just like Java) and only comments are allowed above it

One package object allowed per package and can help you place common/utility code within this file without declaring a class.
Code within the package object is then visible to all members of the package.
Imports

To import all members of a package use an underscore.

Example - import com.fun.scala.demo._ (different than Java where you use an asterisk)

Cool stuff with import statements - you can rename classes to avoid collision

Example - import java.util.{Date => UtilDate}
          import java.sql.{Date => SqlDate}

Default imports - In every Scala source file, the following packages/objects are implicity imported:
* package java.lang
* package scala
* object scala.Predef
